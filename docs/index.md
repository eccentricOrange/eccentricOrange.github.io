I'm an undergraduate student studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I love robotics and programming very deeply and have spent about 12 years making the odd tech projects.

I have an unusual problem. I often find even the commonest of tools and concepts really cool. Why is that a problem? Because I want someone to share my excitement with, and my friends have (rightfully) had enough. So I decided to make this blog.

It is meant to be a collection of all the tools and concepts that I run into, both in my courses, and otherwise. I hope you find them as cool as I do, and are hopefully inspired to learn more about them or something.

You can find a lot of my work on [my GitHub profile for @eccentricOrange](https://github.com/eccentricOrange).
