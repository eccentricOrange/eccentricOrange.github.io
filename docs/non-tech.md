# The other side of tech

## 1.   Why do friends sometimes manage to teach their peers better than teachers?
I help out a lot of my friends out through their courses in college. This is far from unique to me, but many people turn to their friends for help instead of faculty. This also happens to classes with the best and most compassionate teachers I've met, so the obvious answers that friends are more empathetic probably don't apply.

I cannot fully answer this question today, but we'll try to think about it and tackle similar questions on this part of this blog. For now, let's look at some aspects of how I help my friends learn something, and hope that you're able to apply this whenever it's relevant to your life.

### Finding out where they stand
Yesterday, one of my old roommates and good friends (who we'll call Dhruv) kidnapped me and dragged me to the library to help him learn hypothesis testing for his statistics exam. Yeah.

Well, the first thing we did was review his class notes briefly, just to see if his professor had taught something differently from mine. She hadn't, thankfully. The next thing I tried was asking Dhruv to solve the first sort of problems we'd encounter in the 2-3 chapters he'd asked me to help him digest in two hours. For the most part, he did it correctly, but I noticed that he hadn't drawn the normal curve showing the critical reasons. Upon asking him about it, we figured out that he didn't really know how the system worked.

Notice this - by just testing the "student" on real-world problems (or "real-world" problems, in this case), we were able to identify both that he knew the bulk of the steps *and* that he didn't know the fundamental underlying concept. This gave me two tools to boost his confidence: the former to let him understand that he had a foothold, and the latter to show him that it's easy to learn by making him learn.
