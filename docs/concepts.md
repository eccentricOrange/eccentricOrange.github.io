> **A note on CS/programming concepts**
> 
> I maintain a separate website for CS/programming concepts.. Even though it was designed for the CAIE Computer Science syllabus, it is useful for anyone learning CS/programming. You can find it at [https://eccentricOrange.github.io/CAIE-Computer-Science/](https://eccentricOrange.github.io/CAIE-Computer-Science/). I won't cover as many CS/programming concepts here.

## Differential pairs
Think about a signal traveling in a wire. Specifically, think of a digital signal, which is just a voltage that is either high or low (1 or 0, 5V or 0V etc). This is called a **single-ended signal**, because it is referenced to a single point, usually ground.

Now, let's do a weird thing. Let's take another wire, and copy the above signal onto it, but with the opposite polarity. So if the first wire is at 5V, the second wire is at 0V, and vice versa. This is called a **differential signal**, because it is referenced to two points, and the voltage between them is what matters.

At this point, let's assume that there is some noise in our signal.

The single-ended signal is referenced to ground, so the noise is added to the signal. This is bad, because it means that the noise is now part of the signal, and we can't tell them apart.

The differential signal is referenced to itself, so the noise is added to the signal, but also to its "opposite". Guess what? We can simply subtract the two signals, and the noise will cancel out, leaving us with the original signal!

This is why differential signals are used in many applications, such as USB, Ethernet, and HDMI. They are also used in high-speed digital circuits, such as FPGAs and microprocessors.

## Understanding Object-oriented Programming

{: .note-title }
> I gave the following explanation in a [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingHelp/comments/ri7fte/oop_python/howj7xn/?context=3).

{: .tldr }
> These are takeaways that you should incorporate over long periods. But for getting a practical understanding, you do need to read all of it.
> * Many languages like Java require you to mess around with objects and classes for everything. This is probably not good design. [Learn more on this opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM).
> * In general, when part of your **code actually corresponds to some entity**, then OOP is really useful. Examples: a robot, a motor, a database entry, a message frame, a file.
> * If you're familiar with the relevant word processing, presentation, or spreadsheet software, you've already used OOP. A class is like a **template** (so it lays out the design and structure but doesn't have specific content details) and a specific document is like an instance of that class (so it has specific content details, based on the structure laid out by the template).
> * Most things in Python can be manipulated like an object. This is really useful to know as you develop more advances skills.

I'm going to give you a number of analogies here. Don't dwell too much on any given example, we'll link it to coding later.

BTW, I'm generalizing this answer so that it's about OOP irrespective of languages. But I'll show you a snippet of Python code at the end.

### \#1 Think of a specific chair
* **There are going to be some things about the chair that you can think about.** It will have a height of 1 metre, a mass of 2 kg, a black colour, maybe a memorable dent in the hind leg etc.
* **What does it do?** Nothing really.
* **What can happen to it?** It can be moved around, it can be cleaned, it can be broken (yikes!) etc.

### \#2 Think of a specific bus
I'm imagining my school bus.
* It is yellow, it had seats for 60 people, I'm assuming there's 20 litres of fuel in it right now. It had my school's crest painted on the right side.
* **What does it do?** It can move or brake. It can accelerate or decelerate.
* **What can happen to it?** It can be boarded or deboarded, it can be driven, it can be cleaned etc.

### \#3 Think of a specific human
I'm imagining a fictions friend.
* She's 1.7 m tall, has a mass of 62 kg, is kind, is honest, is extremely lazy.
* **What can she do?** She can study, eat, breathe, run, think etc
* **What can happen to her?** Can be transported somewhere, can be requested something, can fall asleep etc.

### \#4 Now think of all possible chairs
You cannot state the colour of all chairs. It doesn't make sense. You don't know the dents of all chairs. But you do know that all of them will have some colour.

You can clean most of them and you can sit on most of them. But you don't know if you move all of them aroundâ€”some may be fixed to the floor.

### \#5 Think of all possible buses
Again, you cannot know the colour of all of the buses, but you can be certain that each bus will have a colour. You cannot know the level of fuel of all the buses, but all of them will have some level (even if it's 0).

Most of them can move or brake, but some might be broken. Most of them can be cleaned.

### \#6 Think of all possible humans
I don't know every human's height and mass, but every human has a measurable height and mass. I don't know how lazy most humans are, however.

Almost every human can breathe and eat. Almost every human can fall asleep. Not all of them can run (e.g. paralyzed people), but a lot can.

### Takeaways
Do you see what we're doing here?

We're assigning some **properties** (such as the level of fuel in a bus) to each _thing_. When we talk about a specific thing, the property has a **value** (such as 20 litres of fuel in the bus). Some things may not share these properties; e.g., if a bus is still under construction, its fuel tank may not have been installed yet so its level of fuel is undefined.

We're also talking about what they can do or what can be done to them. These are **methods** (basically functions or procedures, depending on what they do). Most humans will have the method that they can breathe. Again, many humans will have the running method, but some will not.

When we're talking about things in general (a generalized chair, for example), we're talking about the **class** of chairs. The chair I'm currently sitting in is an **instance** of that class. Your chair is a different instance of the chair class. If the class chair has a method that they can be cleaned, that both our chairs will "get" that method. This process of creating a specific **object** (such as your chair or my chair) from the class (such as the generalized idea of a chair) is called **instantiating**.

But that's repetitive. When discussing the chairs, I had to state that it can be cleaned even though I already mentioned that when I discussed buses. So lets make a **parent class** of non-living things. We'll say that the class of buses and the class of chairs are both **children** of the class of non-living things. Now if I say that non-living things can be cleaned, all buses and chairs will inherit that.

If there is a specific historical instance of chair sitting in a sterile museum, we don't want people touching it. So for that instance, we can specify that it cannot be cleaned.

### What's this got to do with programming?
See for yourself! (Python 3)

```py
class non_living_things:
    def get_cleaned(self):
        print("Being cleaned.")

class bus(non_living_things):
    colour = ""
    fuel_level = 0.0
    number_of_seats = 0

    def be_driven(self):
        print("Driving.")

    def get_boarded(self):
        print("Getting boarded.")

    def accelerate(self):
        print("Accelerating.")

class chair(non_living_things):
    colour = ""
    mass = 0.0
    height = 0.0

    def get_moved_around(self):
        print("Moving around.")

my_chair = chair()
my_chair.colour = "black"
my_chair.mass = 2
my_chair.height = 1
my_chair.get_cleaned()
my_chair.get_moved_around()

your_chair = chair()
your_chair.colour = "red"
your_chair.mass = 2.7
your_chair.height = 1.5
your_chair.get_cleaned()
your_chair.get_moved_around()

my_bus = bus()
my_bus.colour = "yellow"
my_bus.fuel_level = 20
my_bus.number_of_seats = 60
my_bus.get_cleaned()
my_bus.be_driven()
```

Don't stress on stuff like the word `self` for now, it's a rather nuanced concept.
